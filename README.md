# OpenFOAM tips and tricks

This repository was created to gather a collection of OpenFOAM tips, tricks and their evaluation. These experiments were performed during the author's dissertation project at the University of Edinburgh and the EU Horizon 2020 project HiDALGO, more specifically the Urban air pollution pilot.

## 1. General tips

## 2. Testing tips

## 3. Promissing but not-yet-tested tips

* JÃ³zsef Nagy suggests in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcEriOI2Hs) to check a detalied overview at fvSchemes and fvSolution by Gavin Tabor that can be found in [this PDF](ftp://zw.releases.ubuntu.com/sourceforge/o/op/openfoam-extend/OpenFOAM_Workshops/OFW13_2018_Shanghai/Training/A-detailed-look-at-fvSchemes-and-fvSolution.pdf) that includes tips obtained by its author during his fifteen years of experience in OpenFOAM.

* Joel Guerrero, author of some courses/material in Wolf dynamics, has a really interesting document covering general OpenFOAM tips, including the use of `checkMesh` and `renumberMesh`, two computationally inexpensive tools that can assure mesh quality and improve simulation bandwith. 

## 4. Tutorials

* Wolf dynamics has a collection of tutorials that cover basic and advanced OpenFOAM functionalities in [its webpage](http://www.wolfdynamics.com/tutorials.html). The beginner tutorials go over some of OpenFOAM base examples. In addition, this website/organization offers basic and advanced training courses. 

* OpenFOAM official [tutorials](https://wiki.openfoam.com/Tutorials).
